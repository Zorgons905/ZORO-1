 <p>So let me introduce myself.</p>
 <p>My name is Zidan, I’m from East Java, Indonesia, and im currently 18 y.o. when i made this web.</p>
 <p>I got my name from my father, he is a P.E. teacher in SMPN 4 Jombang. He named me Zidan because he likes football a lot (not the american football but the soccer one) in hope his child would be as badass as Zinedin Zidan himself, a famous football player at that time. But as I grew up, I actually dont like football tho wkwk. I prefer chess, bicycling, and playing badminton rather than football 🙃.</p>
 <p> And Honestly when i was a child i made a lot of stupid things. I’ll give you some examples : whacking my head on a wall just because i’d never got a toy car (back then, i only have dolls to play with and a set of toy kitchen, You know.. i have 2 sisters), playing with a kitten under someone’s car and accidentally scarring my head in proccess, so i got that hairless spot you see, and many more. </p>
 <p>Anyway, I always love my family even tho its like an asian typical family. :v (yeah that kinda family that force their kid’s dream based on their parent’s saying, would whoop ass their child if they got a low score, etc.) But still I love my family, especially my mother because she is like my bestfriend throughout my entire life, she could be my supportive mother, my naughty friend, like my teacher, and also being an asian mother 🙃. </p>
 <p>I still gives my respect to my father tho. He is somewhat like a yeah.., how would i say it nicely, a teacher that you usually dont really like, a high toned person, but at the same time he is a good public speaker and have so many friends. And yeah those good things that I really appreciate from my father. </p>
 <p>I dont know how my future would be like, but i hope its a good news, i already got so many “aib” or you could say unluckyness throughout my life. So I’m hoping for the best, for my family, my friends and teachers, as well as other people around me that have a not so good life</p>
 <p>Oh yeah, i forgot to ask you reader, How are you? I hope you doing good, for those of you who still not doing well, dont give up, stay strong and healthy my friend (=∩_∩=)פ</p>
